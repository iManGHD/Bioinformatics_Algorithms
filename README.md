# ComputationalGenomics
This repository serves as a collection of projects and homework assignments from my Computational Genomics course, conducted during my fifth semester of my Master's program at Sharif University of Technology. The course was under the guidance of Prof. Abolfazl Motahari from the Department of Computer Engineering.
