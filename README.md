# ComputationalGenomics_Fall_2023
This repository is a compilation of all the projects and homework assignments from the Computational Genomics course I took during the fifth semester of my Master's program at Sharif University of Technology. The course was instructed by Prof. Abolfazl Motahari in the Department of Computer Engineering.
